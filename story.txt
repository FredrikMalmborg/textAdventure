an old dusty light bulb slowly swaying in the middle of the room.

- search the room -
:: With a sweeping look over the delapitated area you identyfy a few things..
There is one door to the place, on the righthand side of the door there is a shady looking
plant huffing and puffing on a filthy cigar. Left of the door the roof seem to have fallen in 
and on the floor a bunch of odd moldy planks lie in a heap.
behind you on the left quite close the the planks there is a big pool of coagulated stale blood.
From the pool leading to inbehind a cupboard in the corner on the oposite side of the shady plant
is a trail of the congealed old looking substance. the cupboard is closed but not sealed in any 
obvious way.

What do you do?
