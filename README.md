## Description
A game based entirely on using the cmd like terminal to input what you want the character to do. Use this to 
navigate the bizareo world on the room where nothing makes sence but also does.

You interact with the world by typing. One. command. at. a. time.
In the game you can choose ether : use, give, open, kick, search, take : to interact with the items in the 
room that you are stuck in. Based on what you do different scenarios will play out and you'll have to 
manouver your way around all obstacles and get out of the room.

I tried to make it work for mobile but the way i coded the input field has to be in lowercase, i tried but failed to 
implement a clean cool sulotion for that but in lack of time i forfeit my attempt.

The game is best played in the browser and with the top bars turned off (F11)
